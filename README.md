It is a high-level programming language, and its core design philosophy is all about code readability and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in a few lines of code.  In this article, we will use random module to make a word guessing game. This game is for beginners learning to code in python and to give them a little brief about using strings, loops and conditional(If, else) statements.  random module : Sometimes we want the computer to pick a random number in a given range, pick a random element from a list, pick a random card from a deck, flip a coin, etc. The random module provides access to functions that support these types of operations. One such operation is random.choice() method (returns a random item from a list, tuple, or string.) that we are going to use in order to select one random word from a list of words that weâ€™ve created.
